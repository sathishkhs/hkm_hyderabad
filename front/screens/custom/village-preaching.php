                           <p>Cows, Huts, Mud roads, Big tadi trees, Lake, Wells, & Full greenery around with innocent people, Culture & Ethical values vth beautiful relations. these thoughts which floats in our mind when we remember about the villages. But due to modern civilization those valuable things are sinking. Industrialization & other revolutions creating lot of opportunities for the society by looking at these things farmers and other people in the villages are leaving their traditional works migrating towards the cities . so poverty is increasing tremendously.</p>

                   <p>In ancient times poor person means he will have at least 10 cows and one house and he is sufficient. Our acharya Srila Prabhupada also says if a person is having one cow and small for agriculture then he is self sufficient and he can lead his entire life peacefully with out any disturbance</p>

These programs are has been conducting since 5 years in many villages like Raicharla, Edualbad etc..</p>
