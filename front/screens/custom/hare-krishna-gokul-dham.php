                            <p>Modern society is living in perpetual dissatisfaction and suffering due to lack of religion and universal values, typical symptoms of Kali-yuga, where some people want to enjoy God’s creation but leaving God aside. Our founder Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, wanted to establish spiritual embassies where everyone could find a respite from the material sufferings and a true meaning of what our life is all about.</p>
