                           <p>Yes, I want to do some Seva to the Temple.

Seva should be done WITHOUT personal motivations</p>
<p>“Anyone who engages in spiritual devotional service without motivation, rendering such service for the satisfaction of the Lord, is elevated immediately to the spiritual platform, and all his activities are spiritual.” (CC Adi 14.29, Purport)</p>
<p>Here is the list of Services that you can render to the Temple for the pleasure of Their Lordships Sri Lakshmi Narasimha and Sri Krishna</p>
