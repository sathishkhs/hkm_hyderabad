                           <p>As per the diverse yugas or ages, like Satya-yuga, Treta-yuga, Dvapara-yuga, and Kali-yuga, there are distinctive processes for spiritual development that have been more recommended than others. For instance, meditation was the recommended procedure for Satya-yuga, when people lived longer and could sit in fixation or in samadhi for longer periods. In Treta-yuga it was best to take part in different extravagant rituals, yajna’s or fire sacrifice. In Dvapara-yuga it was best to participate in elaborate worship, with sumptuous offerings to the prayers and Deities and mantras sung to the Deities. In this way, these processes have proceeded down through the ages to some degree or another. But, in Kali-yuga, however despite everything we see these procedures has been used, now it is the chanting of mantras, especially the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, that is the most proficient and recommended procedure of spiritual development in this age.</p>

                   <p>Srila Prabhupada says: “You can also establish the kirtana hall on the farm and install Gaura Nitai Deities. Gaura Nitai can be established anywhere, and it is simple to worship them simply chant before Their Lordships. He doesn’t mind that you have not decorated very nicely, but if you chant and dance He is very pleased.” (SP Letter to Madhudvisa, Melbourne, 21 April 1976)</p>
                   <p>Followed by the words of SP, we can worship Nitai Gauranga just by chanting Hare Krishna mantra, As a major aspect of various initiatives, HKM-Hyd began a Program called “Intinta Nitai Gauranga” (Lord Nitai Gauranga in Every house). Where in around 170 families who are practising Krishna consciousness genuinely received Nitai Gauranga deities to worship in their homes each day.</p>
